# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The `ComparisonDashboard.jsx` component has been successfully refactored and split into multiple smaller, more maintainable files to improve code organization and make it easier to add new functionality.

## New File Structure

### Hooks (`src/hooks/`)
- **`useDatasetManager.js`** - Manages dataset uploading, switching, and file operations
- **`useDataProcessing.js`** - Handles data processing and aggregation logic
- **`useSampleAnalysis.js`** - Manages sample selection, search, and export functionality

### Components (`src/components/`)
- **`DatasetManager.jsx`** - File upload interface and dataset management
- **`ChartsSection.jsx`** - Performance charts and visualizations
- **`SummaryStatistics.jsx`** - Statistical summary table
- **`KeyInsights.jsx`** - Key insights and performance highlights
- **`SampleDetailsSection.jsx`** - Individual sample analysis and detailed view

### Utils (`src/utils/`)
- **`formatters.js`** - Utility functions for data formatting and metric calculations

### Updated Main Component
- **`ComparisonDashboard.jsx`** - Simplified main component that orchestrates all sub-components

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components and hooks can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Easier Testing**: Smaller, focused components are easier to test
4. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
5. **Simplified Development**: New features can be added to specific components without affecting others

## Key Features Preserved

- File upload with drag and drop
- Multiple dataset management
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Sample-level analysis
- Export functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Responsive design

## Next Steps

With this new structure, it will be much easier to:
- Add new chart types to `ChartsSection.jsx`
- Extend data processing capabilities in `useDataProcessing.js`
- Add new dataset formats in `useDatasetManager.js`
- Implement additional analysis features in separate components
- Add new utility functions in the `utils` folder

The application maintains all existing functionality while providing a much cleaner and more extensible codebase.
